You need to create a website under github.com with:
○ Intro to the problem
○ Different approaches by different games (use animated gifs when possible)
○ Description in detail for the selected approach
○ Links to more documentation
○ TODOs and Solution inside the repository as VS projects
○ Optional Homework for practicing
○ Explanation of any other improvements on the system

It defines all technology related items that should be considered.
● Code Style, Platforms supported, code organization overview (UML).
● Branch workflow, code reviews, performance budgets.
● Functionality and limitations expected to communicate to the team.

## Introduction
Modern digital games can be considered as large software projects which run and are made up of thousands of lines of code to millions of lines of code. Object-Oriented Design came into existence to deal with large software projects. The GDD or TDD are made for keeping in mind all the demands of Object-Oriented Programing along with the implementation details (TDD for technical details and GDD for entire Game Details) within it.

### What is a Technical Design Document?
The Technical Design Document provides a blueprint for the software engineers in your team to implement and code the features of your game. The technical design document will let your developers to specify what are the requirements, how they should be implemented, along with the tools and technologies required for the implementation. The connection between structural design of a Software and Technical Design Document is that the technical design document has a broader scope with less details, than a software architecture diagram.

### The relation of the TDD with the GDD
The GDD is the soul of a videogame, it is equivalent to the "Bible" of a television series. This document will be used as the base for the development of the game. It contains a summary of The TDD is a specification for all the technical aspects of the features which are defined in the Game Design Document (GDD).

So, we could say as [Laura Deng](http://lauradeng.com/eng/?p=187) tells us in her website that *"while a GDD is derived from the game concept and is a functional description of the game from the user’s point of view, while a TDD is an architectural description of the game from the implementer’s point of view.*

## Sections of a Technical Design Document
The information contained in a TDD can vary depending on the company or the game. Nevertheless there are sections which are more usual than others, so we will divide them in what I have called core sections and optional sections.

### Core sections


* List of all features.
* Choice of Game engine.
* High level diagrams.
* Details about the 3D objects, terrain, scenes.
* Use of Physics Engine.
* Game logic and artificial intelligence.
* Audio and Visual details and specifications.
* Networking.
* Delivery platform & hardware/software requirements for running the game on a system.

### Optional sections
