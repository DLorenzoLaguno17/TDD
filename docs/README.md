# Technical Design Document
“I am [Dani Lorenzo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-lorenzo-laguno-a2ab35180/), student of the [Bachelor’s Degree in Video Games by UPC at CITM](https://www.citm.upc.edu/ing/estudis/graus-videojocs/). This content is generated for the second year’s

## Object-Oriented Design
Modern digital games can be considered as large software projects which run and are made up of thousands of lines of code to millions of lines of code. Object-Oriented Design came into existence to deal with large software projects. The GDD or TDD are made for keeping in mind all the demands of Object-Oriented Programing along with the implementation details (TDD for technical details and GDD for entire Game Details) within it.

## Technical Design Document
The Technical Design Document provides a blueprint for the software engineers in your team to implement and code the features of your game. The technical design document will let your developers to specify - what are the requirements, how they should be implemented, along with the tools and technologies required for the implementation. The connection between structural design of a Software and Technical Design Document is that the technical design document has a broader scope with less details, than a software architecture diagram.

A TDD generally contains the following information:

* List of all features.
* Choice of Game engine.
* High level diagrams.
* Details about the 3D objects, terrain, scenes.
* Use of Physics Engine.
* Game logic and artificial intelligence.
* Audio and Visual details and specifications.
* Networking.
* Delivery platform & hardware/software requirements for running the game on a system.
*[Here](https://computergamesmmu.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/technical-design-document-final.pdf) we have a very good TDD example (designed by some students for their college project.
